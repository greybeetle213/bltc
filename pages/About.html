    The Big Little Theatre Company is a two-pronged Ashburton-based theatre company.  
    </p>
    <p>
    BLTC inc., is a production company which performs annual shows. Each show we produce is both extremely high in quality and rich in experience for the young actors.  We are currently rehearsing for ‘There’s an Element of Risk’ – made up of both Senior and Junior students – incorporating a lot of students' own writing.  Tickets will be on sale soon, for performances in August. 
    </p>
    BLTC actor training offers weekly lessons for young actors aged from 6 - 18. Our lessons help children build confidence, make meaningful friendships and grow into incredible actors. We train every Tuesday and offer a unique series of acting workshops. We also prepare students for Trinity College (London) Examinations, and have a track record of outstanding success.
